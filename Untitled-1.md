🎯 **Perfect! I'll be ready to continue exactly where we left off.**

## 📋 **Status Summary for When You Return:**

**✅ Current Progress:**
- [`/c:/Users/Valued Customer/OneDrive/Documents/_CAM ASSISTANT/SRC/config.py`](/c:/Users/Valued Customer/OneDrive/Documents/_CAM config.py ) - Complete and ready
- All your existing JSON data files - Ready to integrate
- Modular system structure - Set up

**🎯 Next Steps When You're Back:**
1. **Extract exact functionality** from your working [`/c:/Users/Valued Customer/OneDrive/Documents/Davenport_Cam/Work Space/projects/cam-assistant/cam_assistant_REV21.py`](/c:/Users/Valued Customer/OneDrive/Documents/Davenport_Cam/Work Space/projects/cam-assistant/cam_assistant_REV21.py )
2. **Split into clean modules** while maintaining identical functionality
3. **Add the missing Reference Charts tab** (Tab 5)
4. **Create the exact same professional interface** as your working system

**📂 Target Modular Structure:**
- `main.py` - UI and navigation (matching your working system exactly)
- `src/cam_operations.py` - Spindle operations 
- `src/thread_calculator.py` - Threading calculations
- `src/quote_builder.py` - Cost analysis and quotes
- `src/drill_chart_content.py` - Reference charts
- Plus the other modules

**Have a great meeting! We'll create the perfect modular version of your working system when you return.** ⚙️🚀

Ready to resume and make this happen! 👍
