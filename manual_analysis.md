# Enhanced CAM Operations Analysis

# Based on Davenport Manual Methodology

## Key Enhancements Needed:

### 1. Add Effective Revolutions Calculator per Manual

The manual shows:

- Steel bushing example: Threading needs 72 effective revolutions (longest operation)
- Brass screw example: Finish turn needs 90 effective revolutions (13/16 ÷ .009")

### 2. Standard Feed Per Revolution Database

Manual standards:

- Form tools: 0.0025"/rev
- Counterbore drills: 0.005"/rev
- Through hole drills: 0.0035"/rev
- Cutoff: Calculated from wall thickness

### 3. Cycle Time Calculation Enhancement

Manual formula:

- Effective Revs ÷ (RPM ÷ 60) + Index Time
- Steel example: 72 revs ÷ 30.167 RPS = 2.386 + 0.4 = 2.8 sec

### 4. Operation Comparison & Optimization

Manual approach:

- Find longest operation
- Optimize other operations around it
- Suggest operation splitting when beneficial

### 5. Enhanced Cam Selection with Block Validation

Manual method:

- Select cam with rise ≥ needed
- Calculate block setting = rise_needed ÷ cam_rise
- Validate 0.8 ≤ block_setting ≤ 1.2

### 6. Wall Thickness Calculations for Cutoff

Manual example:

- .300 OD - .150 ID = .150 ÷ 2 = .075 wall thickness
- Using 5/32 cam: .075 ÷ .0035 = 21.4 hundredths

These enhancements would make your CAM assistant follow the exact Davenport manual methodology.
